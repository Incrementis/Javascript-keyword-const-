			Use your browser to check
			if this <br> 
			<img src = "Error.JPG" alt = "NO PICTURE FOUND!"> <br>
			Error appears!<br>
			If so than "const" keyword is used as a constant and can not be updated.<br>
			If not and an alert window appeared in the first place than "const" can be used as a synonym for "var".
