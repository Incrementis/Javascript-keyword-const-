# Javascript-keyword-const-

Welcome to the Javascript-keyword-const- project!

There are javascript implementations which handle various features in a different way.
In this case the focus lies in the keyword const. 
Some js implementations allow const to be used like the keyword var and in others it is used as a constant.

The Javascript-keyword-const- project shall help to identify which one of those supports is given by understanding the outcome.

Just download the files and execute index.html. 
Note that all files should be placed in the same folder so that the functionality of the code is guaranteed.
